A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed

. This behavior is sometimes referred to as "most-recent" first. Java has a built-in Stack class, but it is not recommended for use due to its limited functionality compared to other data structures such as the Deque interface

.
A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. In an array-based implementation, the top of the stack is represented by a variable that keeps track of the index of the last element added

. In a linked list-based implementation, a reference to the most recently inserted item is maintained, allowing for the addition and removal of items at the beginning of the list without affecting other elements

Stacks have numerous applications, including arithmetic expression evaluation, function-call abstraction, and backtracking

. For example, in arithmetic expression evaluation, stacks can be used to parse infix expressions by pushing operands and popping them when an operator is encountered

. In function-call abstraction, stacks can be used to keep track of function calls and return addresses, allowing for the correct execution of nested function calls

.
In Java, stacks can be implemented using the built-in Stack class or by writing a simple class that uses an ArrayList to store the elements

. When implementing a stack, it is important to ensure that all operations, such as push, pop, and peek, run in constant time O(1)
3
. This can be achieved by using an array or a linked list as the underlying data structure and ensuring that the top of the stack is easily accessible

In summary, a stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO principle and can be implemented using an array or a linked list. Stacks have numerous applications, including arithmetic expression evaluation and function-call abstraction, and are an important concept in computer science.
