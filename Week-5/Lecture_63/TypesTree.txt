Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to store hierarchical data. In Java, trees are often implemented using various classes and interfaces provided in the Java Collections Framework.

1) Binary Tree: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. In Java, you can implement a binary tree using a class that has references to its left and right children.

2) Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary search tree is a type of binary tree in which the nodes are ordered in a specific way that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. In a BST, the value of nodes in the left subtree is less than the value of the parent node, and the value of nodes in the right subtree is greater than the value of the parent node.

3) AVL Tree: AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This property ensures that the tree remains balanced, which helps to keep search, insertion, and deletion operations efficient.

4) Red-Black Tree: Red-black tree is another self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit for representing the color (red or black) of the node. The tree maintains certain properties such as the black-height property and the red property, which ensures that the tree remains balanced.

5) B-Tree: B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient search, sequential access, insertions, and deletions. B-trees are commonly used in databases and file systems where large amounts of data need to be stored and accessed efficiently.

6) These are some of the common types of trees used in Java, each with its own characteristics and suitable applications. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you can choose the appropriate type of tree to efficiently manage and manipulate hierarchical data.
