Binary tree traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes in a binary tree in a specific order. There are three primary methods for traversing a binary tree:

1) Inorder Traversal:
Visit the left subtree.
Visit the root node.
Visit the right subtree.
In other words, for a binary search tree, this would visit the nodes in ascending order.
2) Preorder Traversal:
Visit the root node.
Visit the left subtree.
Visit the right subtree.
This traversal is useful for creating a copy of the tree or when it's necessary to visit the root node before its children.
3) Postorder Traversal:
Visit the left subtree.
Visit the right subtree.
Visit the root node.
This traversal is useful for deleting or freeing the nodes of the tree.
These three traversal methods can be implemented recursively or iteratively. Each traversal algorithm has its specific use cases and can be applied depending on the problem requirements.
