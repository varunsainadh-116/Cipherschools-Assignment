To remove a loop in a linked list, you can use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm to find the node where the loop starts and then break the loop by setting the next pointer of the node before the loop to null.

Here's how you can do it:

Detect the Loop: Use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm to find whether there is a loop in the linked list. This algorithm involves using two pointers, one moving at twice the speed of the other. If the two pointers meet at some point, there is a loop.

Find the Start of the Loop: Once the loop is detected, reset one of the pointers to the head of the list and move both pointers at the same speed. The point where they meet again will be the start of the loop.

Break the Loop: After finding the start of the loop, traverse the list again with one pointer starting from the head and another pointer starting from the meeting point of the two pointers in the previous step. Move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The point where they meet is the node just before the loop. Set the next pointer of this node to null, effectively breaking the loop.
