Time complexity is a measure used in computer science to analyze algorithms based on the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It helps in understanding how the algorithm's runtime grows with the size of the input. It's a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis, especially when dealing with large data sets where efficiency matters.

Notation:
Big O Notation (O):
Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity.
It provides an asymptotic upper bound for the growth rate of the runtime of an algorithm.
It is represented as O(f(n)), where f(n) represents the upper bound function describing the worst-case behavior of the algorithm.
Omega Notation (Ω):
Omega notation is used to describe the lower bound of an algorithm's time complexity.
It provides an asymptotic lower bound for the growth rate of the runtime of an algorithm.
It is represented as Ω(f(n)), where f(n) represents the lower bound function describing the best-case behavior of the algorithm.
Theta Notation (Θ):
Theta notation is used to describe both upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's time complexity.
It provides a tight bound on the growth rate of the runtime of an algorithm.
It is represented as Θ(f(n)), where f(n) represents both upper and lower bounds, meaning the runtime of the algorithm grows at the same rate as f(n) in the worst and best-case scenarios.
Little O Notation (o):
Little O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity, excluding the tight bound.
It provides an upper bound that is not asymptotically tight.
It is represented as o(f(n)), where f(n) represents a function that grows faster than the runtime of the algorithm.
Little Omega Notation (ω):
Little Omega notation is used to describe the lower bound of an algorithm's time complexity, excluding the tight bound.
It provides a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight.
It is represented as ω(f(n)), where f(n) represents a function that grows slower than the runtime of the algorithm.
In summary, time complexity notation helps in understanding and comparing the efficiency of algorithms by providing insights into how their runtime scales with the input size. It is a crucial tool in algorithm design and analysis.
